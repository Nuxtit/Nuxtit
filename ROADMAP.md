# Tabled

- Any moderator tool
- Reddit Gold - features, giving gold, etc.
- Keyboard shortcuts
    - high interest, perfection desired.
- Swipe/TouchEvents
- RES integration: implement the following features from preexisting RES data:
    - tagged users
    - filter comments/posts
- Offline storage of subreddits, threads, users
    - LocalStorage is MB, other solutions are complicated.
    - Syncing sounds like it would impact battery usage over time.
    - may require addition of backend infrastructure.
- filter user's history by search + subreddit
- quickly edit own flair

# Avoiding Consideration

- Optional Infinite Scrolling
    - only if your position is not whiped out when returing from a result.
    - looking to mitigate the need for it via the Queue feature.

Showing the sidebar.

It's very common to have to explain and re-explain what's listed in the sidebar because "lol I can't read it I'm on mobile right now".
