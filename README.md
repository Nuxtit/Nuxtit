## Features

Browse Reddit! We're working to add the majority of basic features to reduce the amount of times you need to leave the app. There is a lot of work left to to do! Most places will have a link allowing you to quickly goto reddit while we still have a lot of work to do. (Update!) We have so many things implemented (voting, commenting, crossposting, mod stuff, etc.) that you should open an issue if you want something specific.

Use settings menu to quickly censor usernames for screenshots. Note that you can tell which two posts were posted by the same user because of the color. Now you don't have to figure out how photoshop works on your phone just to censor usernames (do not get yourself in trouble for doxxing/brigading!). We'll leave the censor usernames feature on for our screenshots.
